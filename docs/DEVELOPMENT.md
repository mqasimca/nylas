| `make ci` | Quality checks only (no integration tests) | Quick pre-commit |
| `make build` | Build binary to `./bin/nylas` | Development |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts | Clean workspace |

### Testing Commands

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make test-unit` | Run unit tests |
| `make test-race` | Run tests with race detector |
| `make test-integration` | Run CLI integration tests |
| `make test-air-integration` | Run Air web UI integration tests |
| `make test-coverage` | Generate coverage report |
| `make test-cleanup` | Clean up test resources |

### Quality Commands

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Integration Tests

```bash

make test-integration
```

**CRITICAL:** Air tests create real resources. Always use `make ci-full` for automatic cleanup.
